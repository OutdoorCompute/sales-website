                    <h2>2024 March 08 - Edge computing trend</h2>
                  </div>
                  <h5>History Edge Computing</h5>
                  <p><strong>Edge computing</strong>, a concept originating in the 1990s, aims to bring computing closer to end-users. Initially utilized as Content Delivery Networks to reduce network transit and load times for videos and websites.</p>

                  <p>The term <strong>Cloudlets</strong> was coined around 2009, focus primarily on addressing latency issues. Traditionally, apps or websites run on devices connected to distant powerful clouds containing data and processing power. However in "fog computing", many cloudlets are deployed within the same region, extending the cloud and bringing it closer to the end-user, enhancing the responsiveness of apps and website. Technologies requiring real-time low-latency, such as 5G, Industry 4.0, augmented reality, and IoT, significantly benefit from cloudlets.</p>

                  <p><strong>Modular Integrated Sustainable Data Centers</strong> (MISD, coined 2023) share similarities with cloudlets but emphasize sustainability. They incorporate elements such as heat reuse, electricity net dynamics, and efficient distributed computing.</p>

                  <h5>Current and future challenges</h5>
                  <p>The strain on electricity grid is increasing due to ongoing electrification, while the demand for cloud services is growing rapidly. Concurrently, the shift towards sustainability and a circular economy presents already significant challenges. These trends have a positive effect on our society and the environment but present major challenges.</p>

                  <p>Nonetheless, it's inspiring to witness the variety of solutions emerging, for example high-density energy storage, novel solar panels, heat isolation techniques, smart systems, recycling initiatives, and innovative heat extraction mechanisms. Enumerating all researchers and organizations in this blog post would be exhaustive and will require a seperate blog post.</p>

                  <h5>Solution in cloud industry </h5>
                  <p>To address these challenges in the cloud industry, smart and efficient systems are imperative. Numerous researchers and innovative organizations are developing solutions, each with its unique approach. To accelerate innovation in MISD-related solutions, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion euros in research support.</p>

                  <p>We firmly believe that our society will inevitably transition to full sustainability and circularity. Our <strong>Cloud Unit</strong> represents a significant stride towards making the cloud industry not only sustainable but also environmentally friendly. It goes beyond being just a Modular Integrated Sustainable Data Center; we offer a comprehensive Cloud Service compatible with most cloud providers. By instantly converting existing cloud environments into sustainable and cost-effective ones, we are pioneering a shift towards a greener cloud ecosystem.</p>

                  <p>We envision a world where the cloud seamlessly integrates into society, creating value for businesses by reducing cloud costs and enabling consumers to directly reuse waste heat. Furthermore, we invite everyone to invest in our expanding cloud network of Cloud Units, contributing to a more sustainable future for all.</p>
