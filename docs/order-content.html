                    You can benefit by using the heat that is produced by the cloud. Just like a heat pump, but without the noise and energy costs.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    We can swiftly deploy a Cloud Unit but we will need some information to ensure a smooth integration. We will help you with answering the following questions:
                    <ol>
                      <li>What is your heat requirement (kWh) and which outlet temperature is desired?</li>
                      <li>Which Cloud Unit configuration is best suited for your situation (cooling tower, buffer tank).</li>
                      <li>Is your current network connection sufficient?</li>
                      <li>And discuss the possible location and integration with existing heating systems</li>
                    </ol>

                  <h4>Case studies:</h4>
                  <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Dark Green LLC</strong>:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>use case</strong>: Working towards a green society is a key pillar of Dark Green LLC. They do not only offer consultancy on energy green solutions but have also invested heavily in their own eco-friendly company. This results in an excess energy production of their solar panels.

                          The excess electric power is consumed by the Cloud Unit, instead of delivering the excess electric power back to the energy grid at a low price. The business does not only uses their excess electric power more effective but can also use the waste heat from the Cloud Unit to heat their building, reducing heating expenses.</li>
                        <li><strong>How can the Cloud Unit add value?</strong>: </li>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Use excess green energy more effective</strong>, OutdoorCompute has found an IT company that is willing to run their batch jobs in the Cloud Units that are located at Dark Green LLC, especially between 11:00 and 18:00. Dark Green LLC has shutdown their Central heating system because Cloud Unit provides enough heat for the whole office.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </ul>

                      <li><strong>Jan Jansen</strong>:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>use case</strong>: Jan Jansen has build a beautiful new private building. The building is connected to the electricity grid but no other sources of energy are available (gas connection or district heating). He is forced to use an electric boiler for heating his building. This is possible because he has a well isolated building and solar panels that generate electricity.</li>
                        <li><strong>How can the Cloud Unit add value?</strong>:</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Eliminate energy bill (heating</strong>), Jan Jansen invests in a Cloud Unit. The electric energy is now used for an useful purpose (cloud) and the "free waste heat" can be used for heating the private building.</li>
                          <li><strong>No maintenance</strong>, OutdoorCompute handles everything, he does not have to worry about maintaining the Cloud Unit.</li>
                          <li><strong>Passive income</strong>, he will not only eliminate his electric bill due heating but also receives interest on its investment.</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Public Data Processing LLC (NGO)</strong>: </li>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>use case</strong>: Our platform offers a free public service to the world. But cost is always an issue as a non-profit organization.</li>
                        <li><strong>How can the Cloud Unit add value?</strong>:</li>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>The Cloud Units can be placed anywhere</strong> where heat is needed. So this organization decided to place their Cloud Units at local Homeless Shelters. When individuals use the digital services of "Public Data Processing LLC" then Homeless Shelters will save on energy costs.
                            <li><strong>Cloud integration was easy</strong>, we just plugged Cloud Unit into our own cloud environment. When the Cloud Unit is available we saving 40% on cloud costs ($20k each month) while enjoying the high reliability of the cloud.</li>
                        </ul>
                      </ul>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Creative Video Creation LLC</strong>: </li>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>use case</strong>: Latency and processing power is essential for an effective workflow. We need to modify large video files and the rendering of the intermediate and final video's requires powerful servers. In our office we have a small server room where four powerful servers are located. We can store our data (TB's) and render multiple video's at once with this setup. We use software like chaos v-ray for rendering.</li>
                        <li><strong>How can the Cloud Unit add value? </strong>:  </li>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>More office space</strong>, server room is not needed anymore and can be repurposed for an useful purpose.</li>
                          <li>More cloud for the same price, we sell the Cloud Unit at cost and have developed many innovations that you can leverage.</li>
                          <li><strong>Latest server technologies</strong>, benefit from hyperscaler technologies like liquid immersion cooling.</li>
                          <li><strong>No vendor or cloud lock-in</strong>, you can install any software you like. OutdoorCompute can assist if help is needed.</li>
                          <li><strong>Cloud service</strong>, you do not have to worry about the physical maintenance. We provide a truly cloud experience and maintain the physical servers to ensure a high up-time.</li>
                          <li><strong>Heating and electrity cost reduction</strong>, air conditioning requirement in the server room is eliminated and heat produced by servers is used to heat building.</li>
