                  <h3>Levels of cloud integration</h3>
                  <p>
                    We support three levels of integration with each its own cons and pros:
                  </p>

                  <h4>1. Full Cloud integration</h4>
                  <p>
                  Full Cloud integration allows you to deploy cloud services directly into the Micro Data Center. This solution is more expensive than the other solutions we provide because the cloud provider charges additional fees for running their cloud software outside their infrastructure. But still less expensive than similar on-premise or co-location solutions. Full cloud Integration is suitable if you must (by law) support the public cloud software locally.
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/" target="_blank">AWS Outpost</a></li>
                      <li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-stack/hci/" target="_blank">Azure HCI</a></li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Do you have regulatory constrains and insist on using AWS outpost, Azure HCI or similar solutions? Then we can discuss how to integrate the cloud servers directly into the Micro Data Center. The benefit is that you can reuse the heat and do not need to build an expensive server room.
                  </p>

                  <h4>2. Integration with cloud service (FaaS/PaaS)</h4>
                  <p>
                    A Event Driver Architecture like AWS lambda, Azure Functions or Apache Kafka are very easy to connect with the Micro Data Center. Instead of running your logic in containers or FaaS runtime instances you deploy them into a Runtime instance in the Micro Data Center. That's it, you have just saved on compute expenses and have become the greenest IT company (with an social impact).
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/web-apps/serverless/architectures/web-app" target="_blank">Azure Functions</a></li>
                      <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank">AWS Lambda</a></li>
                      <li><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/" target="_blank">Kafka</a></li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <h5>Use case: Azure Service Bus</h5>
                  <p>
                    The Azure Service Bus queue accumulates messages transmitted from various FaaS components. In the Micro Data Center, hundreds of code instances can be operated, which are effortlessly deployable via our API. These instances are designed to immediately process any new messages appearing in the Service Bus queue.
                  </p>

                  <p>You could deploy code instances that require a high amount of compute resources or thousands of instances that process small compute jobs. The result can be <strong>stored locally</strong> into the Micro Data Center, effectively improving inter-process latency and reducing network transit.</p>

                  <h4>3. You manage the full technology stack (IaaS)</h4>
                  <p>
                    You can use our API or Terraform plugin to (re-)deploy your favorite OS onto the servers. We recomment using configuration management tools like Puppet, Chef, Ansible or SaltStack to deploy software solutions.
