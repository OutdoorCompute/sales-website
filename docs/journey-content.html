									<h2>2023 December 13 - ACE Pitch and Beers</h2>
                  <p>
                    ACE facilitated a great "Pitch and Beers" event. We brought our stress-test micro data center version to give the attendees an idea of our product. We gave a 3 minute pitch to a jury and audience consisting of mentors, VCs and other stakeholders. We receive excellent questions from the jury and audience. It gave us the opportunity to evaluate the response on our business strategy and product.

									<h2>2023 September 15 - EuroBSDCon 2023</h2>
                  <p>
                    We thoroughly relished our experience at EuroBSDCon 2023. The event proved to be not only excellent in terms of content and organization but also unfolded in an incredibly delightful location steeped in rich history. It was a perfect blend of informative sessions and a captivating venue that added an extra layer of enjoyment to the overall experience.

                    We believe that we can build a great startup if we work together with specialists who are passionate about the technology stack. And want to use their skills to build a more sustainable world and have a positive social impact on society. It would even be better if we could re-contribute to opensource technologies that we love and use every day.
