                  <p>Before deploying our Cloud Unit to the customer location, we had the valuable opportunity to introduce it to some of our strategic partners and investors. At our company, we are passionate about hard work and committed to building a sustainable future for data centers. Realizing this vision would be impossible—and far less enjoyable—without collaborating with passionate and forward-thinking people.</p>

                  <p>Our network of Cloud Units allows companies worldwide to effortlessly enhance their Azure cloud, making it more cost-effective, truly sustainable, and green. At the installation site, it allows solar panels or wind turbines owners the chance to earn extra income by selling their excess localized green electricity to the network.</p>

                  <p>We extend our sincere thanks to everyone who attended the meeting on such short notice (within just 7 days). For those who couldn’t make it or were not invited, don’t worry—we will be hosting another session at the Cloud Unit’s operational site soon.</p>

									<h2>2023 April 21 - Co-Lab YES!DELFT</h2>
                  <p>
                    The Co-Labs provided us with invaluable opportunities to connect with fellow founders, fostering a vibrant network within our entrepreneurial community. These sessions were not only enriching but also included informative discussions on effective strategies for identifying and attracting new co-founders, emphasizing key characteristics essential for successful partnerships.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yes!Funded played a pivotal role by enlightening us about diverse funding options and subsidies available for our startup. Through their extensive network, they facilitated crucial connections with key contacts, including those from RVO and other subsidy providers. We express our sincere gratitude for the invaluable support and insights received.
